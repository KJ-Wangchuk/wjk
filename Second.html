<h2>Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day</h2>
  <p class="author">
    BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEAR
  </p>
<pre>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of
  May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date;
Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometimes declines,
By chance or nature's changing course
  untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possesion of that fair thou ow'st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his
  shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:
  So long as men can breath or eyes can see,
  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</pre>
  <h4>Thank You</h4>
